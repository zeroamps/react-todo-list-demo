# React Todo List Demo

The todo list is a React demo application where a user can keep track of their daily, weekly, and even yearly tasks. See [DEMO](https://zeroamps.github.io/react-todo-list-demo/).

I created this demo because I wanted to try [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). Other interesting libraries I use in the project are [Formik](https://formik.org/) together with [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup), [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) and [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/).
